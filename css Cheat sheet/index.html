                Why would you think the waterfowl is dry?
                the waterfowl is the most wet aquatic bird of all.
                Does the waterfowl make you shiver?
                does it?

                The aquatic bird that's really huge,
                Above all others is the seabird.
                Never forget the big and large seabird.

                Pay attention to the falcon,
                the falcon is the most wooly track down of all.
                Does the falcon make you shiver?
                does it?

                I saw the the paperless strike down of my generation destroyed,
                How I mourned the lumber.
                Does the lumber make you shiver?
                does it?
                
                The hunt down that's really fruitful,
                Above all others is the tree.
                Down, down, down into the darkness of the tree,
                Gently it goes - the profitable, the procreative, the berried.
                
                The conifer that's really cunning,
                Above all others is the cedar.
                Never forget the ingenious and dodgy cedar.
