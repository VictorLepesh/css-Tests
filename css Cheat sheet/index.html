                Why would you think the waterfowl is dry?
                the waterfowl is the most wet aquatic bird of all.
                Does the waterfowl make you shiver?
                does it?

                The aquatic bird that's really huge,
                Above all others is the seabird.
                Never forget the big and large seabird.

                the falcon is the most wooly track down of all.
                Does the falcon make you shiver?
