9. for localeCompare 
"=== looks for exactly the same bytes in the strings.

.localeCompare() allows for the fact that you may want to ignore certain differences in the strings (such as puncutation or diacriticals or case) and still allow them to compare the same or you want to ignore certain differences when deciding which string is before the other.
